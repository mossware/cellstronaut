    "long_summary": "Scientists trained and selected male mice to study how their bodies adapt to long-term spaceflight aboard the Bion-M 1 satellite. They focused on social housing, handling, and a special paste diet to reduce aggression and stress. Mice were monitored before, during, and after the flight for behavior, food and water intake, and physiological responses. The study shows that proper training and environmental enrichment can prepare mice for complex space experiments.",

      "Mice adapted well to the paste food diet, which significantly increased water intake and urine output without adverse effects.",

    "short_summary": "Snail astronauts: how space changes balance and behavior!",
    "long_summary": "Researchers studied land snails that spent 30 days in space to see how their balance system, the vestibular system, adapts to weightlessness. They measured snails' movements, tentacle positions, and nerve responses both after spaceflight and during readaptation to Earth's gravity. The snails showed changes in behavior and physiology as a response to microgravity, but were able to readapt within about 20 hours after returning. This study shows that even creatures evolved for constant gravity can adjust to its temporary absence.",

      "Postflight snails displayed altered tentacle movements and gravitaxis behavior due to vestibular system adaptation to microgravity.",

Using various microscopy techniques, researchers detailed the arrangement of hair cells, synapses, and nerve connections that help the fish sense gravity and motion.

It also highlights variations in hair cell density and synaptic organization that could influence how sensory signals are processed.",

    "long_summary": "This study examines how the otolith vestibular receptors develop in Japanese quail, detailing epithelial growth, hair cell formation, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation. Hair cells in the striola develop first, followed by extrastriolar regions. Planar cell polarity of stereocilia establishes directional sensitivity early in development, reaching adult patterns by E10. Afferent innervation progresses from bouton fibers to dimorph and finally calyx afferents. The spatial organization of afferents in adult quail mirrors patterns seen in other birds, with calyx afferents in striola and bouton fibers in extrastriola. The study provides insight into the developmental sequence of hair cells and afferent wiring that underlies vestibular function in birds.",

      "Calyx afferents have large axons and fewer hair cell contacts, dimorph afferents are diverse and multi-branched, and bouton afferents have extensive arborization."

    "long_summary": "This study explored the microorganisms associated with abnormal, injured, and poorly regenerating tissue in the endangered Ozark Hellbender salamander (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi). By culturing and identifying bacteria and fungi from affected and unaffected individuals, researchers found opportunistic pathogens, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas spp., Granulicatella adiacens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and filamentous fungi like Penicillium, Fusarium, and Cladosporium. These microbes, many capable of forming biofilms, were mostly present only in injured tissue, suggesting they may exacerbate tissue damage but are unlikely the sole cause. Human-induced habitat changes, nutrient loading, algal blooms (e.g., Cladophora spp.), reintroduced species such as river otters and hatchery trout, and recreational disturbances may increase injury and microbial exposure. While causation could not be confirmed due to the endangered status of the species, this work provides the most comprehensive profile of external microbial consortia in Cryptobranchid salamanders and highlights multiple factors potentially contributing to population decline.",

They looked at gene expression, proteins, and liver tissue to see how microgravity and space stressors change lipid metabolism. They found that spaceflight caused abnormal fat buildup in the liver, altered key metabolic pathways, and affected proteins that help process lipids. These changes were seen in different mouse strains and across mission durations, suggesting that space alone can trigger liver issues. The results hint that similar problems could occur in humans during long-term space missions.",

Mice spent 37 days on the ISS in microgravity, and their ovarian and vaginal tissues were analyzed for hormone levels and gene expression. The study found that mice continued to show normal estrous cycles, and ovarian gene expression related to steroid production was mostly unchanged. Progesterone levels were slightly lower in some space and habitat control mice, but estradiol stayed the same. These findings suggest female mice can maintain reproductive cycling during extended time in space.",
