Researchers analyzed tno1 knockout mutants for root skewing and epidermal cell rotation under microtubule stabilization and destabilization conditions. Microtubule array orientation was unaffected, indicating TNO1 regulates cell file rotation independently. The study also examined mature root and hypocotyl regions for cell morphology maintenance. Findings highlight the role of TNO1 and the trans-Golgi SNARE machinery in epidermal cell orientation and expansion during root growth.",

    "full_summary": "The EDEN ISS space-analog greenhouse in Antarctica was operated from February to November 2018 to study plant cultivation for future human space missions. Researchers grew 26 different crops on a 12.5 m² area, focusing on lettuce, leafy greens, and fresh vegetables. The study recorded edible and inedible biomass, dry weight ratios, and environmental conditions such as light intensity, temperature, humidity, and photoperiod. They tracked crop performance across multiple cycles and cultivars, including leafy greens, lettuce varieties, and herbs, to evaluate overall productivity and growth characteristics under controlled conditions.",

      "A total of 268 kg of edible biomass was produced, primarily cucumbers (67 kg), lettuce (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg).",
      "Yearly productivity was 27.4 kg/m² or 0.075 kg/(m²*d).",
      "Leafy greens performance varied by cultivar and light intensity, with mizuna and high-light arugula performing best.",

They measured kernel size, weight, starch granules, and protein layers to see if microgravity affected the quality of the grain. Overall, the kernels looked normal, with only slight differences in weight, starch composition, and aleurone layer cell width. The study suggests that wheat can produce good-quality grain in space under controlled conditions, and computer scanning could help detect subtle asymmetries in kernels.",

    "long_summary": "This study investigated how rice roots maintain proper gravitropic growth, focusing on the interplay between ethylene signaling, auxin distribution, and mechanosensing. A rice mutant, crw1, lacking functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1 showed coiled roots in hydroponics due to excessive ethylene signaling. This caused overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins, increased ROS in the root tip, disrupted auxin distribution, and reduced root cap stability. Gentle mechanical resistance, like that in water-saturated paddy soil, activated Ca2+-dependent mechanosensing, promoting degradation of OsEIL1/2 and restoring gravitropic growth. The study highlights how mechanosensing balances ethylene-auxin signaling and suggests natural variation in OsCRW1 levels can influence stress resilience and root growth behavior.",
